    "Generators: It is another way of creating iterators in a simple way where it uses the keyword “yield” instead of returning it in a defined function. Generators are implemented using a function. Just as iterators, generators also follow lazy evaluation. Here, the yield function returns the data without affecting or exiting the function. It will return a sequence of data in an iterable format where we need to iterate over the sequence to use the data as they won’t store the entire sequence in the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterators: An iterator is an object which contains a countable number of values and it is used to iterate over iterable objects like list, tuples, sets, etc. Iterators are implemented using a class and a local variable for iterating is not required here, It follows lazy evaluation where the evaluation of the expression will be on hold and stored in the memory until the item is called specifically which helps us to avoid repeated evaluation. As lazy evaluation is implemented, it requires only 1 memory location to process the value and when we are using a large dataset then, wastage of RAM space will be reduced the need to load the entire dataset at the same time will not be there."

    "Yield is a keyword in Python that is used to return from a function without destroying the states of its local variable and when the function is called, the execution starts from the last yield statement. Any function that contains a yield keyword is termed as generator. Hence, yield is what makes a generator. yield keyword in Python is less known off but has a greater utility which one can think of."
