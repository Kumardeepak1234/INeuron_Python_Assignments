    "Q1.What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "As an expression, lambda returns a value that can optionally be assigned a name. In contrast, the def statement always assigns the new function to the name in the header, instead of returning is as a result. lambda's body is a single expression, not a block of statement"
